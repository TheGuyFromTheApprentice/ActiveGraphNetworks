# Active Graph Theory (AGT): The BaseCube Framework

## Vision
**Purpose**: To create a scalable, self-sustaining framework for modeling dynamic relationships across time, domains, and contexts.

**Core Philosophy**: Chaos isn’t the absence of order—it’s the seed of structured relationships waiting to be defined. AGT bridges the gap between complexity and clarity.

## Key Concepts

### 1. The Cube
- The foundational unit of AGT, representing a single context, system, or entity.
- Contains its own **T0 layer**:
  - Defines its local relationships, attributes, and rules.
  - Knows its position in the hierarchy relative to other cubes.
- **Inputs and Outputs**: Dynamically adapt based on time (T1), queries, or evolving relationships.

### 2. Dynamic Relationships
- **Synthetic Nodes**: New nodes and relationships are created dynamically as the system evolves.
- **Recursive Logic**: Relationships expand hierarchically and recursively, enabling infinite scalability.

### 3. Time Layers
- **T0**: The base layer for all cubes.
- **T1**: Progression through time, defining growth and computation requirements.
- **Time as a Dimension**: Relationships evolve over time, creating a living network of insights.

### 4. Hierarchical Self-Awareness
- Each cube knows its **parent, child, and sibling relationships**.
- Can query **upward, downward, or laterally** to adapt to new contexts.

### 5. Governance with ACLs
- **Access Control**: Managed with ACLs, RBAC, ABAC, and PBAC for granular control.
- **Efficiency**: Loads and updates only when queried, minimizing resource usage.

## Implementation

### 1. The BaseCube Dataset
- A public implementation of AGT principles, hosted on Kaggle.
- Represents the foundation for exploring relationships, scaling, and hierarchical structures.

### 2. Functionality
- Stores, processes, and queries data within cubes or across the network of cubes.
- Outputs from one layer feed into the inputs of the next, enabling recursive processing.

### 3. Key Features
- **Self-Sustaining Intelligence**: The system can run autonomously or adapt dynamically based on queries.
- **Scalability**: Applies to small datasets (e.g., patient data) or large-scale systems (e.g., entire ecosystems).

## Applications

### 1. Healthcare
- Modeling patient data across hospitals to improve diagnosis, treatment, and outcomes.

### 2. Finance
- Dynamic modeling of markets, relationships between assets, and real-time risk assessments.

### 3. AI and Neural Networks
- A framework for creating Relational Graph Neural Networks (RGNNs) that mimic real-world complexity.

### 4. Evolutionary Systems
- Modeling the relationships between entities across time, driving insights into growth, decay, and transformation.

## Next Steps

### 1. Documentation
- Formalize the BaseCube’s purpose, structure, and potential use cases.
- Create a comprehensive README for GitHub and Kaggle.

### 2. Community Engagement
- Publish explanatory posts on Medium and LinkedIn.
- Host an AMA on Reddit to invite collaboration and feedback.

### 3. Visual Demonstrations
- Develop interactive visualizations to showcase how cubes interact, grow, and scale.

## Conclusion
The BaseCube Framework is more than a dataset—it’s the foundation of a living system that adapts, evolves, and scales across domains and contexts. By democratizing this framework, we’re inviting a global community to explore its potential and shape the future of dynamic intelligence.

# Enterprise Application and Scalability

## 1. Efficient Resource Utilization
AGNs are designed to operate efficiently with minimal resources, making them suitable for enterprise applications where cost control is a critical factor. They can function effectively using CPU resources, significantly reducing the total cost of ownership.

## 2. Scalability Across Industries
AGNs are suitable for various industries, including finance, healthcare, and defense, adapting to both cloud and on-premises environments. Their multi-domain architecture enables them to function as a robust AI solution for enterprises looking to integrate AI-driven decision-making at scale.

## 3. Policy-Based Framework
The use of policies and inheritance structures allows AGNs to control access and data flow, providing a layer of depth and flexibility in enterprise deployments. This policy-driven approach makes AGNs an ideal choice for applications that require tight security and compliance.

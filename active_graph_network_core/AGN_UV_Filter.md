# AGN UV Filter - Real-Time Light Processing with Active Graph Networks

### Overview
The **AGN UV Filter** is an experimental real-time video processing tool powered by **Active Graph Networks (AGN)**. It leverages Python and OpenCV to explore and visualize light interactions, such as UV fluorescence and edge detection, directly from a standard webcam. By combining cutting-edge concepts from **4D programming** and **graph-based processing**, this project demonstrates how Active Graph Networks can enhance traditional video processing workflows.

This project showcases how AGNs can model frame-by-frame relationships dynamically, storing data in a structured graph while enabling intelligent, domain-specific processing (e.g., UV filters, night vision, and edge detection). The tool is a practical demonstration of applying **Active Graph Theory (AGT)** for real-time applications.

### Features
- **Multiple Filters**: Toggle between different modes to process video feeds:
  - **UV Filter**: Highlights UV-like fluorescence by isolating light wavelengths and suppressing visible noise.
  - **Night Vision**: Enhances contrast and simulates low-light viewing conditions.
  - **Edge Detection**: Detects and highlights edges within the video feed.
- **Active Graph Networks Integration**: Each processed frame is stored as a node in a graph, with relationships dynamically modeled for tracking and analysis.
- **Graph Visualization**: Automatically generates a visualization of the relationships between frames, showing how AGNs track real-time data.

### How It Works
1. **Webcam Feed Processing**:
   - Captures video frames in real-time and processes them based on the selected mode.
   - Applies various filters to emphasize specific light properties or features.
2. **Active Graph Networks (AGN)**:
   - Frames are added as nodes in an AGN, with metadata (timestamp, mode, relationships).
   - Relationships between nodes (e.g., temporal or visual transitions) are stored dynamically.
3. **Visualization**:
   - Outputs a graph-based visualization of frame relationships and processed results.

### Why This Matters
This tool bridges the gap between traditional computer vision techniques and graph-based data modeling. By embedding frame relationships into a graph structure, it demonstrates the power of AGNs to:
- Capture dynamic, structured insights from unstructured data.
- Enable complex reasoning over time, useful in applications like surveillance, anomaly detection, and interactive visualizations.
- Showcase how graph-based methods can scale to other use cases, such as **image upscaling** or **pattern recognition** in visual datasets.

### Demo Example
In one example, the UV filter highlights **uranium glass fluorescence** under UV light, showcasing its ability to isolate UV-like properties from a video feed. The night vision filter further enhances contrast, and the edge detection mode outlines features in real-time, all while building a graph representation of the process.

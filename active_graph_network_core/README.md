# 🔩 Active Graph Network Core (AGN)

**Layer 2 — Structural Memory, Relational Logic, and Policy-Based Intelligence**
*Part of the Active Graph Intelligence Stack*

---

## 🧠 Purpose

This is the **core framework layer** of the AGN system — the structured backbone where **memory, relationships, and policies** are formed.
Here, nodes represent entities. Edges encode meaning. Time and logic guide the graph.

AGN Core defines how intelligence **stores, adapts, and evolves** within structured domains.

## 🧩 Core Concepts

- **Cubes (T₀):** Context containers — memory capsules with time-based evolution.
- **Policies:** Rule-based logic governing flow between nodes (RBAC, ACL, ABAC, PBAC).
- **Synthetic Nodes:** Emergent nodes formed through dynamic conditions or offset queries.
- **Recursive Awareness:** Nodes that know their position and can query laterally, upward, or downward.

## 🧬 Systems Integration

| System              | Integration                                                                               |
| ------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AGDB**      | Supplies temporal offset structure and synthetic time-based traversal                     |
| **QFN**       | Consumes AGN structure to perform symbolic collapse and meaning reconciliation            |
| **Smart-ETL** | AGN nodes feed into Smart-ETL transformation layers across temporal and relational planes |

## 🛠 AGN in Practice

Want to build your own system?

1. Start by defining `Cubes` with known T₀ node types.
2. Apply `Policies` to control access, flow, and decision-making.
3. Use AGDB to structure time, and feed outputs into QFN for cognition and field collapse.

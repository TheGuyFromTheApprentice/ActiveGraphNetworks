# Technical Deep Dive into AGNs and AGDB

## 1. Active Graph Database (AGDB)
AGDB is a hierarchical graph database designed to support the relational mapping of AGNs. It enables better structuring, indexing, and retrieval of complex relationships, ensuring that AGNs can efficiently manage multi-domain data.

## 2. Contextual Relational Mapping
AGNs utilize AGDB to create contextual relationships through attributes and policies. This relational mapping is essential for contextual reasoning, enabling AGNs to understand data within and across multiple domains, dynamically adapting in real-time.

## 3. Efficiency and Scalability
AGNs operate effectively even on lower hardware configurations such as CPUs, which significantly reduces infrastructure costs while maintaining scalability. Unlike traditional AI models that often require GPU clusters, AGNs are designed for enterprise scalability without the need for high-cost infrastructure.

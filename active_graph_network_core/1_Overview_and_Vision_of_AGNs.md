# Overview and Vision of AGNs

Active Graph Networks (AGNs) represent a next-generation AI framework designed to tackle the complexities of real-world, interconnected problems. Unlike traditional AI models that often excel in isolated, domain-specific tasks, AGNs bring multi-domain understanding and contextual reasoning into play.

The vision behind AGNs is to create a practical, efficient solution for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI), rooted in enterprise-grade architectural thinking. By leveraging the power of graph structures, policies, and layered relationships, AGNs enable real-time adaptability, explainability, and scalability across industries.

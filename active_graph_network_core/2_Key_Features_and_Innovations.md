# Key Features and Innovations of AGNs

## 1. Dynamic Relationships
AGNs connect data points while understanding the strength, direction, and context of these relationships. This enables AGNs to adjust connections dynamically based on real-time data, providing unparalleled adaptability compared to traditional models.

## 2. Policy-Driven AI
AGNs implement policy-driven AI, akin to access control mechanisms in IT systems. Policies dictate how nodes interact, inherit attributes, and how data flows through the network, making the decision-making process more transparent, scalable, and adaptable.

## 3. Multi-Domain Structure
AGNs organize data into logical domains like healthcare, finance, and legal systems, allowing cross-domain reasoning without needing to retrain the model for each specific domain. This allows AGNs to adapt effectively to different datasets.

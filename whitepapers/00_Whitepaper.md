It looks like there was an issue with the Mermaid diagram syntax. I've corrected the code to ensure it renders properly. Here are the revised versions:

### 1. **Mermaid Diagram for AGN, AGDB, and RGN Framework Components**

### 2. **Mermaid Diagram for Leveraging Azure Services to Host AGN, AGDB, and RGNs**

```mermaid

    B --> C[AGN Web App]
    B --> D[AGN API Services]
    B --> E[Azure Blob Storage]

    subgraph Azure Core
        C
        D
        E
        F[AGDB - Azure SQL Database]
        G[Azure Function Apps]
        H[Azure Key Vault]
        I[Azure Monitor]
        J[Azure Virtual Network]
    end

    D --> F
    D --> G
    G --> H
    F --> I
    C --> J
    D --> J

    G --> K[RBAC and Security Policies]
    H --> L[Secrets and Encryption Keys]
    I --> M[Logging and Monitoring]
    J --> N[Network Security & Firewall]
    
    subgraph AI/ML Integration
        O[Azure ML Service] --> P[Model Deployment]
        P --> D
        P --> Q[Predictive Analytics in AGNs]
    end
```

These versions should render properly when pasted into a Mermaid editor or compatible platform. Let me know if you need further adjustments or additions!

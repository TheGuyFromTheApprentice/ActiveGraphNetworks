# 🧠 Quantum Field Networks (QFN)

**Layer 2 — Field Cognition and Symbolic Collapse**
*Part of the Active Graph Intelligence System*

---

## 📍 Overview

Quantum Field Networks (QFNs) extend Active Graph Networks (AGNs) into the domain of **relational cognition**, where **structure collapses into meaning**. This layer is where **nodes become tensions**, and **relationships activate based on context, time, and purpose**.

Inspired by quantum state theory — but built entirely on classical compute — QFNs enable dynamic intelligence that is **field-aware**, **contextual**, and **intentionally responsive**.

## 🔁 Relationship to AGNs

| Layer          | Role                                               |
| -------------- | -------------------------------------------------- |
| **AGN**  | Structural Memory & Relational Graph               |
| **AGDB** | Temporal Encoding & Offset Query Logic             |
| **QFN**  | Symbolic Collapse, Cognition, Relevance Activation |

QFNs are the **neocortex** atop AGNs — where patterns reconcile, nodes collapse into decisions, and meaning emerges through field alignment.

## 🧩 Core Principles

- **Δn > θ** → Collapse occurs when identity displacement exceeds resonance threshold.
- **T0 → T1 → T2** → Cognition propagates through latent to activated states.
- **X + Y → n** → Structure and variability combine to produce dynamic output.
- **Policies & Rules** govern relationship evolution across time and context.

## 🛠 Integration Points

| With               | How                                                                                   |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AGN Core** | QFN nodes inherit structure from AGNs but interpret via context                       |
| **AGDB**     | Field activation maps to temporal offsets and synthetic nodes                         |
| **LLMs**     | Acts as grounding or compression layer feeding relational memory into GPT-type agents |

## ✨ Next Steps

- Integrate QFN states into AGN query engine
- Visualize `Δn > θ` collapses via ActiveShell or real-time dashboards
- Extend RGNN schema to support dynamic inference and memory updates
- Develop interactive tools for exploring field dynamics in Smart-ETL flows
